# inStock - Inventory Management for Small Businesses

Initial market discovery interviews found that certain small businesses (< 10 employees) suffered from routine stock-outs w/ average of $25k cash "sitting on the shelf" waiting to be utilized. inStock allows employees to aggregate all product sales information towards a unified inventory forecast prediction. We use an order-up-to statistical formula taken from a certain Operations Strategy class. See [PredictionCalculatorTemplateExcel.xlsm](PredictionCalculatorTemplateExcel.xlsm)
